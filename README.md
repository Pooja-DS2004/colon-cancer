Colon cancer detection using Machine learning 

Abstract
Around the world, it ranks as one of the primary factors of mortality, in great part because colonic carcinoma is difficult to diagnose early. A deep 
learning and image processing algorithm using machine learning such as Random Forest, Neural Networks, SVM, etc., is being developed for early identification of colonic carcinoma. Image segmentation recognizes significant features in colonoscopy photographs, and classification algorithms can distinguish between healthy tissue and malignant growth. The users can interact with the system through the web interface, get diagnosis results, and predict material insights from the developed prediction models.
